				<h1>Introduction to the Business Model of the Bit&amp;Nibs Project</h1>

				<h2>Main Goal:</h2>

				<p>The Bit&amp;Nibs Project originated thanks to the change of conscience that occurred when disruptive technologies were created and shared around the world. Some of the most important examples of these technologies are: the block chain, the bitcoin, the 3D printers and the smart contracts.</p>

				<p>But the Bit&amp;Nibs Project not only has grown thanks to these technologies, but it has also grown thanks to the movements originated by the Internet’s users’ new forms of interaction with these technologies. Concepts such as crowdsourcing, prosumers, bootstrapping, and crowdfunding have inspired us and they have also convinced us of the effectiveness of the work done from different perspectives. </p>

				<p>This important change of conscience in the society has motivated us to create a project that includes not only the desirable characteristics of a company built during the third industrial revolution, but also a company that could include the biggest amount of people. These people will gain courage and will be able to show this courage inside a company where everyone has the opportunity to feel like the owner. </p>
			 
				<p>Today the world is passing through one of its most confusing times. We found ourselves caught between the fear brought by the economic crisis and the hope we have in the many opportunities the new technologies can bring us.</p>

				<p>In this context, the most reasonable answer is not to panic and not to be paralyzed by fear. In this way, the solution to our problems begins with a proposal to change, to improve our lives and the lives of our clients.</p>

				<p>The main strategy of Bit&amp;Nibs is the distribution and selling of Latin American cocoa in Europe. However, we believe that we can create a new paradigm in the way of doing business, and we believe that this new paradigm can work efficiently in other contexts.</p>

				<p> The Bit&amp;Nibs project will open the opportunity for people to obtain money. But more than that, this project represents the search of a more transparent and fair business model: a business model that can influence other spheres of society, and, therefore, we will adopt business models that will benefit everyone.</p>

				<h2>Bit, who can join the Bit&amp;Nibs Project?</h2>

				<p>Perhaps we should start with the people that are not invited to join us::</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Speculators searching for a short term monetary benefit</li>
					<br>
					<li>People who like to be cheated investing in fake promises made in a web page.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>So the people who can join our project are:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Investment angels or early adopters who look forward to investing in a bootstrap destined to become a startup in the medium term.</li>
					<br>
					<li>People interested not only in making money but also people interested in investing in companies that can originate social values.</li>
					<br>
					<li>People who can’t make a monetary investment but who have the time and the aptitudes to generate assets within the project by practicing crowsourcing and by participating in other activities within the project.</li>
				</ol>

				<h1>Market Segments</h1>
				

				<p>The project aims to curve the space between the producers and consumers in the market, throughout technology and good work.</p>

				<p>Trying to shorten the distance between producer and consumer might seem counterproductive for a project based on producer and consumer. However, it allows us to obtain many benefits that can be interpreted as a great competitive strength.</p>    
				<p>We will assure the loyalty of producer and of consumer. The producer will obtain a bigger amount of benefits from his or her job and the quality and originality of the product will be guaranteed to the consumer.</p>

				<p>From this perspective, producer and consumer are clients, because this is how we work: throughout the payment of commissions, obtained after each transaction is finished.</p>

				<p>Therefore, our main goal is to focus the effort in generating a higher volume of transactions of lower commission.</p>

				<p>In order to assure the desired sales volume, we will diversify, as much as possible, the market segments with which we are going to work.</p>

				<h1>The Value Proposition</h1>
				
				<p>The main objective of the Bit&amp;Nibs Project is to sell chocolate and cocoa, our chocolate and other people’s chocolate. The value proposition, in this case, is focused in the way we are going to develop the selling of these products.</p> 

				<p>The traditional organizations of fair trade were not as fair as they should have been. The opacity of such organizations did not allow for people to proof the veracity of their proposals and within time they created a network of lies and corruption.</p> 
					
				<p>In this specific aspect the Bit&amp;Nibs Project will be innovative, because it will guaranty its transparency throughout the technology of the block chain and the smart contracts.</p>

				<p>Another aspect of our value proposition is related to entertainment and pedagogy. We understand that a change in the world is imminent, so we want to participate in that change and make our clients feel as if they are the most important elements of this project.</p>
				
				         <p><strong>Innovative Products and Services:</strong>
						 Our main product will be a web page destined to offer our group of products and the products of other people. A web page where you can offer services and products is not innovative, but our main innovative element is the use of the cryptocoin as a marketing tool.</p>
					     <p><strong>Price:</strong>
						 Firstly, we want to offer a broad range of products made by third parties so we must contemplate a wide array of prices. This array of prices may extend from the products offered as reward for loyalty, to products destined to specialized market segments. The prices will be set in accordance to the markets’ expectations.</p> 
					     <p><strong>Brand ansd Status:</strong>
						 The identity of the project is linked to the third industrial revolution and its characteristics. We want to raise awareness among our clients regarding this subject.<br>Therefore, we will be the first chocolate company of the world which works focusing in this concept. Our brand will be known for everyone and will be unique because it will highlight a “chocolate for geeks”.</p>
					     <p><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong>
						 A very important number of our activities will be carried out in Venezuela, a country that nowadays has the cheapest and qualified labor of the world. This will allow us to have very competitive prices without sacrificing the retributions of our holders.</p>
					     <p><strong>Access:</strong>
						 The access to our products will be another factor raising the value of our company. The figure of the prosumers will be a key factor to the ubiquity of our products.</p>
					     <p><strong>Use/Comfort:</strong>
						 A great part of our proposal is based on entertainment and pedagogy. When acquiring our products our clients will have access to the chococoins. Since the chocoins are marketing products, they will allow our clients to unlock games and programming courses destined to the whole family.</p>

					<div class="info" title="This part analyzes who does a company reaches the chosen client market (#1) to bring them the value proposition (#2)"></div>
					<h1>Channels</h1>
					
					<p>Logistics is one of the many important aspects to consider when taking part in any successful project, particularly regarding the way in which the clients are going to obtain the products without regards to the location of the client (delivery). </p>
					<p>This aspect gains more importance when considering a company that focuses on the distribution and selling of products created by a third party.</p>
					<p>That is why throughout our business model we will make every effort to explore different types of channels, in order to develop our own efficient delivery channel.</p> 

					<p><strong>Direct Channel:</strong></p>
						<p>Using this channel we will try to reach our clients by means of a direct interaction. This channel is more expensive for the client, but it will give us the best opportunity to obtain the client’s feedback. It will be a service offered in our webpage that will include the mail service to deliver the products the client acquired.</p>

					<p><strong>Indirect Channel:</strong></p>
						<p>This is the main channel we will use in the case of handmade chocolate, because it will be better to sell them in our specialized stores than from our webpage. In this type of channel we hope that the business relationship with the prosumers will be strengthened. The prosumers could easily become our local allies for the distribution of the product.</p>

					<p><strong>Partners Channels:</strong></p>
						<p> Since the company is “decentralized”, the owners—holders— will be located around the world. Each holder will have the possibility (with privileges) to distribute regionally all the products available in the company according to the convenience and compliance of the local laws.</p> 

					<p>All the channels will have a single communicative strategy. Our advertisements will be done mainly throughout internet. Once the client interacts with our web page, the client will be able to deeply evaluate our value proposal (and in an entertaining way).</p>

					<p>Regarding the after-sales, we want to keep in touch with our clients in order to know the client’s opinion related to our products, new business proposals and improvements.</p>

					</div>
					<br>

			<div id="relaciones">
				<div class="info" title="This part analyzes how the company creates links with the clients defined in point #1"></div>
				<h1>Relations with our Clients</h1>
				
				 <p>We will establish different levels of communication with our clients in accordance to the type of service or product the client acquires.</p>

				<p><strong>Personal Assistance and Exclusive Personal Assistance:</strong></p>
				<p>This kind of relation will be established with the clients requiring a personalized assistance to buy any of our products. In this level we will locate the clients that want to acquire our products to produce their own in a big scale.</p>

				<p><strong>Automatic Services:</strong></p>
				<p>This kind of service will come as a part of the client’s interaction with the sales’ department of our web page.</p>

				<p><strong>Communities:</strong></p>
				<p>The webpage will be structured in a way in which every client will have the opportunity to interact with the rest of the users of the platform.</p>

				<p><strong>Collective Creation:</strong></p>
				<p> The webpage will also encourage artistic creations. Each user will have an open space or gallery to show his or her pieces of art and where they will receive the feedback of other users. They will also have the possibility of selling, exchanging or donating their artistic creations.</p>

				<div class="info" title="This part represents the money the company obtains from each of the market segments highlighted in point #1."></div>
				<h1>Source of Income</h1>
				

				<p><strong>By selling products and offering services:</strong></p>
				<p>The main source of incomes will be the selling of products with fixed prices to the consumers. We will also consider offered services to the producers as a source of incomes, such as advertisements in our webpage.</p>
				</div>
				<br>

			<div id="recursos">
				<div class="info" title="In this part we must identify the most important elements for the correct functioning of a business"></div>
				<h1>Key Resources</h1>
				
				<p>Our key resources are focused in the human dimension we want to acquire through the use of disruptive concepts and technologies, such as the block chains and the smart contracts. We believe that this kind of technology can change the world, and we are sure that this will change the world during the third industrial revolution.</p>

				<p>We want to have a voice in these moments of change and we want to offer a voice too to the ones that do not have or cannot find their own voices.</p>
				</div>
				<br>

			<div id="actcl">
				<div class="info" title="In this part we must identify the most important activities a company should develop for the correct functioning of the business model."></div>
				<h1>Key Activities</h1>
				
				<p><strong>Services:</strong></p>
				<p>We offer Latin American producers of cacao and its derivatives the possibility to locate their products in the European market through their own infrastructure and a services network.</p> 
				<p><strong>Platform:</strong></p>
				<p>The creation of a webpage with all the features that we have in mind will allow the interaction of the client with limitless possibilities. On the one hand, it will encourage the client’s loyalty; and on the other hand it will multiply our opportunities to create new sources of incomes, such as the merchandising.</p>
				</div>
				<br>

			<div id="asoclav">
				<div class="info" title="In this part we must identify the network of providers and strategic partners for the correct functioning of the business model"></div>
				<h1>Key Associations</h1>
				

				<p>The key associations of the project will be formed by the clients themselves. We want the clients to take part in the company’s achievements and activities, including the activities that will have a social impact and the activities that will increase the value of the project. Particularly, we want our clients to take part in the dynamics of crowdsourcing.</p> 
				</div>
				<br>

			<div id="costos">
				<div class="info" title="In this last part we will analyze all the costs linked to the development of the business model."></div>
				<h1>Costs Structure</h1>
				
				<p><strong>Model Driven by Costs:</strong></p>
				<p>The last part is not the less important. The first stage of the project will focus in the creation of value in terms of image and efficient work flow. This focus will allow us to guarantee profits to our investors, since we will be creating value to a very low price. Even paying at a very good market price the services that we could hire in Venezuela, we will obtain benefits, because in this country salaries are very low.</p>

				<p id="end">For the following stages we will create a business structure that will be able to make use of the potential of the best cocoa that is cultivated and processed in Venezuela.</p>
